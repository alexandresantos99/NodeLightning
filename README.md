## What areas of the app did you focus on?

 It was focused on the MVVM architecture with concepts of clean arch and unit testing.

##  What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

The idea was to bring an application architecture, thinking about making it as decoupled and scalable as possible.

## How long did you spend on this project?

5 hours.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Yes, I ended up working more on the architecture and testing side than on the UI side.

I would improve some parts of the architecture, for example, creating models for the "domain" and "presenter" layers, adding instrumented tests and improving the app's layout.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

UI.

## Is there any other information you'd like us to know?

I followed the 5 hour time frame and focused on delivering a simple application with an architecture and tests. I believe that with more time I could improve the UI, parts of the architecture and add instrumented tests.
